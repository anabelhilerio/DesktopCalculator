PROJECT TITLE: Desktop Calculator
For this project I created a calculator with three modes standard, scientific and financial. The standard allows you the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. The scientific allows you the ability to compute square roots, sine, cosine, and tangent. The financial mode allows users to compute percentages. There are two buttons that allow you to access the scientific and financial modes of the calculator. By default, the user will always have access to the standard.
